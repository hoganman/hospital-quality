# hospital-quality

This repository explores basic R-lang functionality of how to read real world 
data and execute filtering on it. The data is a snapshot of the "Hospital Compare"
database. The activities are generally guided by the Week 4 assignment "Assignment 3" of
the "Introduction to R Programming" course on Coursera.

See the included R-markdown notebook for the work.
