## Description
This repository explores basic R-lang functionality of how to read real world 
data and execute filtering on it. The data is a snapshot of the "Hospital Compare"
database. The activities are generally guided by the Week 4 assignment "Assignment 3" of
the "Introduction to R Programming" course on Coursera. Use the included
`Hosptial_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf` to understand the CSV table
`outcome-of-care-measures.csv`, which is **entry 19** on page 17.

See the included R-markdown notebook for the work.
